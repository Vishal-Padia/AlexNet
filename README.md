# AlexNet
Building AlexNet from scratch using PyTorch and Python

## Why am I doing this?
I want to start working on computer vision again and what better model to implement than AlexNet. Reason to start working on computer vision again is that NLP is becoming mainstream, I mean it's alright but it's become too much LLMs and it's not like I don't like it, it's just that I am not able to finetune or do anything on this PC (dumbass windows pc). Computer Vision also requires gpu but I can just use colab or kaggle or something else. Computer Vision is also becoming mainstream but it has many possibilities, and I want to create an computer vision project to be precise it's going to use video, so learning CV is good as of now for me.

After sometime I am going to get my hands dirty with speech too, I want to create a basic speech recognition model or something which transforms audio in different accents and so, kinda difficult but I'll do it ig!
